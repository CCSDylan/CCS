Q: What happens if I can not attend a meeting?
	A: We understand that there can be many factors that can prevent a member from coming to a meeting; schoolwork, family death, etc. Nothing will be marked against you as long as you submit an absence request to us at ccompsoc@gmail.com so we can review it and dismiss accordingly. 

Q: What if I don’t have a computer/What if I have a mac?
	A: You do not need a computer to be a member of CCS. We provide computers for the meetings so bringing a computer is not required.
